# Signals-and-Systems-with-Real-World-Applications

##### A common framework: vector space
- vector spaces are very general objects
- vector spaces are defined by their properity
- once you know the properties are satisfied, you can use all  the tools for the space     
##### We need something to measure and compare: inner product(aka dot product 对应点相乘，求和)    
- measure the similarity between vectors
- inner product is zero ---> vectors are orthogonal(maximally different)

##### Hilbert Space
When a vector space equipped with an inner product is also complete, we call the vector space a Hilbert space.(不完整案例，有理数序列求和收敛于无理数，这样的向量空间是不完整的) 

##### Fourier Analysis
Fourier bases for C^N, N是维度
- So we need N different vectors, each one of which will have length N.
- k will be the index that indicates different vector
- small n, to indicate the index of the element within each vector
